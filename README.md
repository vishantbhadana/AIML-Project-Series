Expanded Example Code (Python):

Example Backend Server (Flask)
Create a simple Flask server that serves admission-related information:(using app,py)

Chatbot with Backend Connection
Modify the chatbot to fetch information from the backend server:(using chatbot.py)

Steps to Run the Backend and Chatbot:
Run the Flask Server:

Save the Flask server code in a file named app.py.
Run the server by executing python app.py in your terminal. The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Run the Chatbot:

Save the chatbot code in a separate Python file.(chatbot.py)
Run the chatbot code, which will fetch real-time information from the running Flask server.
This setup will allow the chatbot to fetch real-time admission-related information from a backend server, ensuring that responses are up-to-date and accurate.
